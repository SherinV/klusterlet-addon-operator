Post helm installation steps:

1. Wait for all pods to become ready. You can keep track of the pods either through the dashboard or through the command line interface: 

kubectl get pods -l release={{ .Release.Name }} -n {{ .Release.Namespace }}

2. (Optional) Validate health of pods by running helm tests: 

helm test {{ .Release.Name }} --tls --cleanup
