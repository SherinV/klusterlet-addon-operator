If you are interested in being a contributor and want to get involved in developing `build-harness`, we would love to hear from you! Shoot us an [email](mailto:tpouyer@us.ibm.com).

In general, PRs are welcome. We follow the typical "fork-and-pull" Git workflow.

 2. **Clone** the project to your own machine

**NOTE:** Be sure to merge the latest from "upstream" before making a pull request!

If you want to test your development changes, you can set these environment variables in your Makefile

```
BUILD_HARNESS_ORG=<org/user where fork is located>
BUILD_HARNESS_BRANCH=<branch where changes live on your fork>
```

You  can also set any other parameters defining the location if you have changed them from your default specified in [templates/Makefile.build-harness](templates/Makefile.build-harness)
